I am an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, currently visiting at UC Berkeley. 

My research focuses on constructing capable models and dissecting their behaviors across varied computational and data frameworks. This endeavor is driven by a profound curiosity to unravel the intricacies of deep learning mechanisms and their operational principles.
